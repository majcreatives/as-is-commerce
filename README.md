# As-Is-Commerce

A credit-based auction marketplace for the Ghanaian market. Users buy virtual
bidding credits, spend them to place bids on live auctions, and the account
holding the leading position when the server-side countdown expires wins the
right to buy the product at the auction's checkout price.

All monetary values are in Ghana Cedis (GH₵) and are stored as integer minor
units (pesewas). Never as floating point.

> **Development status — Foundation stage.**
> This repository currently contains the application foundation only:
> authentication, roles, the application shell and the tooling around them.
> The wallet, credit ledger, payments, auction engine, orders and admin tooling
> are built in later stages and are deliberately absent.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
| --- | --- |
| PHP | 8.3 or newer |
| Composer | 2.x |
| MySQL | 8.0 or newer |
| Node.js | 20 or newer |
| npm | 10 or newer |

Redis is **not** required yet. Queues, cache and sessions run on the database
driver during the foundation stage. Redis, Horizon and WebSockets arrive with
the auction engine.

### Required PHP extensions

`openssl`, `pdo_mysql`, `mbstring`, `tokenizer`, `xml`, `ctype`, `json`,
`bcmath`, `fileinfo`, `curl`, `zip`, `intl`

## Installation

### 1. Create the databases

The application and the test suite use separate schemas. Both must exist
before migrating:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE as_is_commerce
  CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

CREATE DATABASE as_is_commerce_testing
  CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

### 2. Install and configure

```bash
composer install
npm install

cp .env.example .env          # Windows: copy .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Then open `.env` and set `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` for your local MySQL
server. `.env` is never committed.

### 3. Migrate and seed

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

Seeding creates only reference data — the `customer`, `admin` and `super_admin`
roles. No demo users, products, auctions, balances or transactions are ever
seeded.

### 4. Build assets

```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Serve

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The application is then available at <http://localhost:8000>.

---

## Development

Run the PHP server and the Vite dev server side by side. In two terminals:

```bash
php artisan serve
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` provides hot module replacement; without it, run `npm run build`
after changing anything under `resources/`.

### Creating an administrator

Admin accounts are never seeded, and no password is ever committed to this
repository. Create one explicitly:

```bash
php artisan app:create-admin --role=super_admin
```

The command prompts for the phone number and for the password with hidden
input. For non-interactive use, set `ADMIN_PHONE` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your
local `.env` — and remove them again afterwards. Passwords shorter than 12
characters are refused.

---

## Testing

```bash
php artisan test
```

Tests run against MySQL using the `as_is_commerce_testing` schema, which is
migrated fresh for each run. They do **not** use SQLite: the auction engine
will depend on MySQL row-locking semantics (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) that
SQLite cannot reproduce, so testing on a different engine would give false
confidence in the area where correctness matters most.

### Code quality

```bash
./vendor/bin/pint --test     # code style check (drop --test to fix)
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse # static analysis, level 6
```

## Architecture notes

The application is a **modular monolith**. Business logic lives under
`app/Domain/`, organised by domain rather than by technical layer, and is
invoked from thin controllers and Livewire components.

```
app/
├── Console/Commands/     Administrative commands
├── Domain/
│   ├── Shared/Phone/     Phone normalization (E.164), swappable per country
│   └── User/             Registration, OTP contract, user exceptions
├── Enums/                UserStatus and future domain enums
├── Http/                 Controllers and middleware
├── Livewire/             Interactive components (auth, profile)
├── Models/
├── Providers/
└── Rules/                Reusable validation rules
```

### Principles this codebase follows

- **The server is authoritative.** Timers, balances, validity and outcomes are
  decided server-side. Client-supplied values are never trusted for
  authorization or for financial decisions.
- **No fabricated data.** Empty states are shown where data does not exist yet.
  The application never displays placeholder balances, auctions or activity.
- **Business rules are configurable, not hard-coded.** Bid costs, auction
  durations, closing windows and fees become configuration, not constants.
- **Money is integer minor units.** Never floats, never `DECIMAL` arithmetic
  in PHP.

### Timezone

The backend operates entirely in UTC (`APP_TIMEZONE=UTC`). Ghana local time is
applied in the presentation layer only. Business timestamps — and later, every
auction and ledger timestamp — are persisted in UTC without exception.

## Security

- `.env` and all `.env.*` files are git-ignored; only `.env.example` is
  committed, and it contains no real values.
- Never commit credentials, API keys or payment provider secrets.
- Never use production credentials in development.
- Login is rate-limited; authentication failures return a deliberately generic
  message so registered phone numbers cannot be enumerated.
- `/health` reports liveness and database reachability only. It exposes no
  hostnames, credentials, paths or exception detail.
